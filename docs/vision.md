# 🌐 AltCred – Project Vision

## 🚀 Overview
**AltCred** is a next-generation full-stack web application built using the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) and powered by **TensorFlow.js** for real-time machine learning.  

The platform aims to redefine how creditworthiness is measured by introducing the **AltCred Score** — an AI-driven, behavior-based alternative to traditional credit scoring systems.  
Instead of relying only on past loans or credit cards, AltCred uses **digital activity, transaction patterns, and behavioral data** to create a fair and inclusive credit assessment.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Millions of individuals — including students, freelancers, and first-time job holders — are **denied access to loans and financial products** simply because they lack traditional credit histories.  

Conventional credit bureaus focus on:
- Past borrowing patterns (credit cards, loans)  
- Bank-reported repayment data  
- Narrow and outdated financial criteria  

This leaves a large population **“credit invisible”**, even though they may have strong **digital reliability and financial discipline** reflected in their online behaviors, subscriptions, and payment records.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**AltCred** introduces an **Alternative Credit Scoring Model** powered by **machine learning** to evaluate users using behavioral and digital trust signals.  

### Core Highlights:
- Analyze **transactional consistency**, **income stability**, and **digital trust**.  
- Generate an **AltCred Score (0–1000)** using a TensorFlow.js model.  
- Enable **enterprises** (banks, fintechs, and credit apps) to integrate AltCred’s scoring APIs.  
- Ensure **data privacy and user consent** through tokenized data-sharing controls.  1

🧠 *AltCred’s goal is to give people a fair chance to prove financial reliability, even without a conventional credit record.*

---

## 🎯 Core Vision
To create a **transparent, fair, and AI-powered credit ecosystem** that democratizes financial access for everyone — from individuals to enterprises.

AltCred envisions:
- **Inclusivity:** Financial empowerment for users with no credit history.  
- **Scalability:** Enterprise-ready APIs for secure integrations.  
- **Privacy:** Full control over how user data is shared and used.
